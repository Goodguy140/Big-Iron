# Big-Iron

This is a discord bot that is able to play youtube videos in the voice channel 
<br>
Currently its in a alpha/beta form and may break at anytime 
<br>

This is one of my first projects and is probably poorly programmed, though maybe to someone it could be useful.


# Setup

To get started download the source code and run `npm install` in the same directory of package.json 
<br> <br>
Edit the `config.json` in the `src` folder of the source code inserting your own Information which you can by creating your own application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
<br>
While in the root directory of the source code, run `ts-node src/index.ts` to start the bot.
